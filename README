dnsfunnel - a small local DNS forwarder
---------------------------------------

 dnsfunnel is a DNS forwarder (aka, a DNS cache without a
cache) meant to listen to local requests and forward them to
real caches. The point is to move from a
"list several caches in /etc/resolv.conf" model to a
"only list 127.0.0.1 in /etc/resolv.conf" one, which has
architectural advantages and isolates the libc's stub resolver
from various DNS implementation infelicities.
