<h1> dnsfunnel </h1>

<h2> What is it&nbsp;? </h2>

<p>
 dnsfunnel is a small daemon listening to DNS client requests over UDP
(typically from the libc's
<a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/getaddrinfo.html">getaddrinfo()</a>
function) and forwards them to a list of DNS caches. It provides the
client with the first answer it gets, trimming the answer so it fits
in an UDP packet.
</p>

<p>
 dnsfunnel is especially useful for distributions using the
<a href="https://musl-libc.org">musl</a> libc, which does not support
TCP DNS transport. It was originally written to be used in the
<a href="https://alpinelinux.org/">Alpine Linux</a> distribution.
